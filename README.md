# testDatabaseProject
Task #1 // Next.JS

This has been one of the most painful things i've done in a while.
MySQL refused to cooperate for the first few days. After finally finding out the issue (which was with my tunneling through PuTTy.)

The backend code is messy, half of it is AI Generated and half of is it is my own pride and joy. The reason is mostly for a lack of time, and since it is my first time ever using Backend code.
I apologize for that.
It now atleast writes to the db.

Im so happy.
