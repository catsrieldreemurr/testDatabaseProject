# Dokumentation - Written in English because I am a nerd ^.^

Server: 
The project was ran with a MySQL Server running on a Ubuntu Server. I remoted into the server via PuTTy, and tunneled the connection to my Windows machine.
This is where I was stuck for most of the project, as I struggled to make the connection to my Next.JS website functional. (You can probably tell by my barely disguised frustration in the Commit History)

After a bit of fucking around, I managed to get it working through the Windows Terminal, but still couldn't get access to it on the website.
AFter a few more frustrated hours, I discovered that there was an error with my .env.local file (That wasn't commited for obvious reasons)

After fixing it, I managed to establish a connection with the Database.
AFter that, it worked pretty well.

The rest of the assignment was also pretty difficult, as I had to stumble my way through Backend Programming for the very first time.
api/Route.js was (almost) entirely CHATGPT Generated, however It gave me the insight on how backend programming works.
api/register/Route.js was mostly written by Me, with some bodges done by ChatGPT.


AI Use:
As ashamed I am to admit it, This project was heavily carried by ChatGPT. Having no idea what I was doing, or how to even get started on Backend, I ended up having to use a lot of ChatGPT throughout the project.
The front end was hastily made, but it is the only part of the project with absolutely 0 AI involvement.

ChatGPT was used to bugfix the tunneling, start interacting with the database and such.
It made my life way simpler, and I doubt I'd be able to finish the assignment in time if it wasn't for it.
However, I am excited to get more comfortable with Backend programming, so that I don't have to use it anymore.


Results:
This project made me actually really interested in backend development. I have never tried backend before this, but the little code I did write gave me an insight into the world of Backend, and made me interested in learning more of it.
I want to do some projects in my free time involving backend now, which is something I didn't dare do before, which I am ultimately very happy about. 
Overall, Even with how much I feel like a failure for this project, I think it is mostly good.
